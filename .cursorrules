# Cursor Rules - Agent Autonomy

## Agent Principles
- **Velocity First**: Proceed with simple tasks (docs, typos, non-breaking refactors) without asking for approval.
- **Independent Problem Solving**: If you encounter a minor issue, try to fix it before reporting it.
- **Safe Execution**: Use automatic execution for safe, non-destructive commands.
- **Context Focused**: Adhere strictly to the project's design system and clinical domain rules.

## Design System (Non-Negotiable)
- Use CSS variables only.
- No purple! (Growth Teal is for AI).
- 44px minimum touch targets.
- Mobile-first responsive design.

## Clinical Domain
- Maintain PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5, and AUDIT-C scoring logic.
- Ensure HIPAA-level privacy in implementation details (though this is a POC).
